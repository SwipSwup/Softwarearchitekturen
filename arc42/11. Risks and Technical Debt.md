| Risk / Technical Debt     | Description                                                                                                                                    |

| Outdated Dependencies     | Using outdated libraries or frameworks may lead to security vulnerabilities and compatibility issues.                                          |
| Service Coupling Risk     | Some services may become tightly coupled due to shared logic or data dependencies, making refactoring or scaling more difficult.               |
| Lack of Automated testing | Initial development may skip full unit/integration test coverage due to time pressure, increasing the risk of undetected bugs and regressions. |
